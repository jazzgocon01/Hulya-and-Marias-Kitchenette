                                     Hulya & Maria's Kitchenette is an online food delivery, serving family favorite dishes inspired by our beloved mother Maria. 
                                     She is known to be a person full of kindness, and through cooking she has shown her love for her family and friends. <br></br><br></br>
                                     
                                     Chicken pupu (fried flour coated chicken with special sauce) is one of the family's specialties. Over the years the dishes 
                                     were innovated with the contributions of each family member. Other mouth watering dishes are Baked Mussels, Beefy Lasagana, 
                                     Crispy Kare-kare with pistachios, Oven Roasted Chicken, Lemon Parmesan Tiger Prawns, Adobo Overload, Baked Beef Mechado, 
                                     Patatim, Baked Pink Salmonl, Gambas and Asparagus, Beef Tapa, Crispy Sisig, Chicken Hawaiian Barbecue, Baked Pork Slab 
                                     and our very own Belly Lechon!<br></br><br></br>

                                     Hulya & Maria’s Kitchenette started in the last quarter of 2017. In 2018 we were featured in the morning tv show Umagang Kay 
                                     Ganda in Abs-Cbn, twice. In the same year our Belly Lechon was highlighted in Spot.ph as top ten no fail boneless belly lechon 
                                     in Manila. From humble beginnings, Hulya & Maria’s has been the number one choice caterer in the showbiz industry.<br></br><br></br>

                                     During this pandemic, Hulya & Maria’s Kitchenette has been and still provides food for our frontliners to most hospitals in Manila 
                                     and Quezon City. We also provided food and bottled water to some checkpoints and homeless.<br></br><br></br>

                                      Today, we wish to continue what we have started. And hopefully we could be of reach to areas around the metro.
